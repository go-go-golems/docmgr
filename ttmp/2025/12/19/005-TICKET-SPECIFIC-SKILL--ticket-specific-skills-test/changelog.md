- Created ticket-scoped skill fixtures and improved skill UX to show ticket id + title for ticket-scoped skills. Also ensured `skill show --ticket ...` works with the installed PATH binary, and updated `skill show` to hide skills from non-active tickets by default unless `--ticket` is provided.
- Added intern onboarding guide reference document for next-day handoff.
