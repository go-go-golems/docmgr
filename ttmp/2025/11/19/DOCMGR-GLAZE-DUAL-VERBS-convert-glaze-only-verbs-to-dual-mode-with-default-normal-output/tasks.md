# Tasks

## TODO

- [ ] Convert `list docs` human output to section-based summaries similar to `list tickets`
- [ ] Identify the next set of glaze-only verbs to upgrade (doc add, ticket create-ticket, meta update, doc relate, task edit)

## Done

- [x] Reshape `list tickets` default output into markdown sections with bullet details (`pkg/commands/list_tickets.go`, docs updated)
