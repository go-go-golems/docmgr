# Tasks

## TODO

- [ ] Optional: consider exposing suggested transitions in structured outputs

## Done

- [x] Document status vocabulary and suggested transitions in help and guides (`pkg/doc/docmgr-how-to-use.md`, `pkg/doc/how-to-work-on-any-ticket.md`)
- [x] Verify doctor warns (not fails) on unknown Status; list valid values in message (`pkg/commands/doctor.go`)
- [x] Add examples showing vocab list for status and how to extend (docs + intern guide)
- [x] Cross-link `ticket close` docs with status vocabulary guidance (closing workflows now point to the vocabulary section)
